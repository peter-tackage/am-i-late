am-i-late
=========

Born out of a Readmill hackathon this is a quick Android hack using location, Google Directions API and Calendar information to determine when you need to leave your current location to arrive at your appointment on time.

It's a bit like Google Now, only slightly less creepy!

Runs as a service and reports information as notifications, so it's not much to look at -

It's built using the Gradle Android Plugin.
