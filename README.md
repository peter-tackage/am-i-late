am-i-late
=========

A quick Android hack using location, Google Directions API and Calendar information to determine when you need to leave your current location to arrive at your appointment on time.

It's a bit like Google Now, only slightly less creepy!

Runs as a service and reports information as notifications.

Is build using the Gradle Android Plugin.

It's got a bit of work to go - https://github.com/peter-tackage/am-i-late/issues
